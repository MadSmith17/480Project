# Project Overview:
We want to create a website that creates a playlist of recommended songs based on the users current mood, genres, and/or current favorite artists. Our goal is to curate better recommended playlists than other industry leading music platforms, such as Spotify or YouTube Music. Spotify only recommends based on listened or liked songs, and very rarely recommends new songs- we hope to improve upon that.

We would also like to add a rating system. Most music platforms lack the ability to rate songs based
on user input. Typically, there are only ways to ”like” a song- that is about it. Our idea would have
the user rate the song on a 5-star scale. We may also ask the user how they are feeling after listening to
a song, genre, album, or artist; providing a list of choices to choose from that we will create. This will
hopefully improve our algorithm and it’s accuracy to recommend songs.
